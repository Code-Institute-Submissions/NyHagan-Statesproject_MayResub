## Design

### Colour scheme
I went with a hot colour scheme with vibrant colours to evoke a sense adventure as each state comes with its own interesting information. Most of the colors are similar to red and are striking to the eye, and will grab ones attention as soon as the site is launched.
 
### Colours that were used

| Color             | rgb                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Persian green | rgb(42, 157, 143) |
| Maize crayola | rgb(233, 196, 106) |
| Sandy brown| rgb(244, 162, 97)|
| Burnt Sienna |rgb(231, 111, 81)  |

The font was largely unchanged in this project, as a design choice, as I struggled to find a font that would work better than the default font in displaying the information without compromising the look and feel of the site while also retaining a professional aesthetic.
